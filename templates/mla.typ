// MLA export template — derived from the MLA Handbook (9th ed.), not from
// refs/*.docx.
//
// This is the deliberate difference from journal.typ. That template
// transcribes the reference documents so the Typst and LibreOffice engines
// can be compared, and so it inherits a Turabian setup: no paragraph
// indent, an 18pt gap between paragraphs, a 1.53in top margin, a 20pt
// display face for headings, and a running head an inch down the page.
// Every one of those is wrong for MLA. Starting from the style guide
// instead of from the reference docs is what makes them not arise.
//
// Nothing here affects journal.typ, the docx chain, or any note that does
// not ask for it: this file is only read when a note sets template: mla.
//
// Parameters come from the note's YAML frontmatter via _typst_wrapper().

// ── Fonts ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// MLA asks for a legible face whose regular and italic differ clearly, and
// names Times New Roman as the usual choice. Student Macs and Windows
// machines both have it; the fallbacks are Times-metric so line breaks
// stay put on a machine that does not.
// De Gruyter Serif first, because it is the one face guaranteed to be
// present: it ships in fonts/ and typst is given --font-path. Everything
// after it is a fallback for a build that somehow lacks the bundle.
//
// It is not Times-metric -- Noto SemiCondensed underneath, so narrower --
// which moves line breaks and page counts. Vertical spacing does not
// move, because conf() pins the line box to explicit lengths rather than
// to whatever the font reports.
// Two backstops, not six. typst warns for every family it cannot find,
// even when an earlier one resolved, and those warnings land in the
// export log a person reads when something has gone wrong. Times covers
// macOS and Windows, Liberation covers Linux, for the case where the
// bundle is missing entirely.
#let body-fonts = (
  "De Gruyter Serif", "Times New Roman", "Liberation Serif",

// ── Vertical metrics ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// "Double-spaced" is a Word measurement before it is a typographic one,
// and a teacher's eye is calibrated to Word. For Times New Roman 12pt,
// Word's double spacing puts baselines 2.30em apart.
//
// Typst's leading is the gap *between* line boxes, so it depends on how
// tall the box is. conf() pins top-edge and bottom-edge to explicit
// lengths rather than to the "ascender"/"descender" keywords, because
// those keywords resolve to the font's *typo* metrics -- 0.693em for real
// Times New Roman, not the 0.891em hhea ascent -- which silently yields a
// 0.907em box and 2.10em spacing instead of 2.30em. Measured, not assumed.
//
// Explicit lengths also make the box identical across every fallback in
// body-fonts, so a machine without Times New Roman sets the same page.
//
//     0.891em + 0.216em = 1.107em line box
//     2.30em baseline-to-baseline - 1.107em = 1.193em leading
#let box-top = 0.891em
#let box-bottom = -0.216em
#let leading-double = 1.193em

// Headings that begin a reference list, and a near-enough plain-text
// reading of a heading for comparison. See turabian.typ.
