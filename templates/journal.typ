// Journal export template — the Typst equivalent of refs/{single,double}.docx.
//
// Every measurement below is transcribed from the reference .docx files that
// the pandoc/LibreOffice chain uses, so the two engines produce comparable
// output. Word stores lengths in twips (1440 = 1in) and half-points; the
// conversions are noted inline. Re-measure against a LibreOffice export
// before changing anything here.
//
// Parameters come from the note's YAML frontmatter via _typst_wrapper().

// ── Fonts ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The reference docs ask for Times New Roman (body) and Aptos Display
// (headings). Typst bundles neither, and a minimal writerdeck has neither
// either — so list real names first and fall back through metric-compatible
// substitutes. Tinos and Liberation Serif are Times-metric; TeX Gyre Termes
// is the usual free Times clone. Aptos has no free equivalent, so headings
// fall back to the serif rather than to something arbitrary.
#let body-fonts = (
  "Times New Roman", "Tinos", "Liberation Serif", "TeX Gyre Termes",
  "Nimbus Roman", "New Computer Modern",
)
#let heading-fonts = ("Aptos Display", "Aptos", ..body-fonts)
#let mono-fonts = ("Consolas", "DejaVu Sans Mono", "Liberation Mono")

// ── Vertical metrics ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Typst's leading is the gap *between* line boxes, whereas Word's w:line is
// a multiple of the font's line height — so the two are not interchangeable
// and leading has to be derived from the line box.
//
// The line box depends on text.top-edge / bottom-edge, whose defaults are
// cap-height and baseline — a box of only ~0.66em. conf() pins them to
// explicit lengths below so the box is 1.107em (ascender 0.891em +
// descender 0.216em), which is what these two constants are derived
// against. Change one, change the other.
//
// The lengths are explicit rather than the "ascender"/"descender"
// keywords because those resolve to the font's *typo* metrics — 0.693em
// for real Times New Roman, not the 0.891em hhea ascent — which made the
// box 0.907em and put double spacing at 2.10em where LibreOffice renders
// 2.30em. Explicit lengths also make every fallback face in body-fonts
// set the same page.
//
//     single (w:line=240)  baseline-to-baseline 1.15em  -> leading 0.043em
//     double (w:line=480)  baseline-to-baseline 2.30em  -> leading 1.193em
#let box-top = 0.891em
#let box-bottom = -0.216em
#let leading-single = 0.043em
#let leading-double = 1.193em

// BodyText carries w:before=180 w:after=180 (9pt each). Word would add
// both between consecutive paragraphs, for 18pt — but the chain this
// template mirrors renders through LibreOffice, which collapses them to
// the larger of the two. Measured on an actual export, the gap between
// paragraphs is 27.6pt + 9pt, not 27.6pt + 18pt.
//
// Typst's par.spacing replaces the inter-line gap rather than adding to
// it, so the leading is folded back in to land on the same baseline
// distance.
#let para-extra = 9pt

  // ── Bibliography ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  //

  // block labelled <refs>; this styles it to match what the Lua filter did
  // to the docx — page break before it, a heading, 0.5in hanging indent.
  //
  // Typst's own bibliography() cannot do this job under a note style: it
  // renders each citation as a *new* footnote, and notes in this vault put
  // citations inside footnotes already (^[Again, @key]). Footnotes do not
  // nest, so the citation silently vanished and left an empty note behind.
  // citeproc knows it is already inside a note and inlines the text.
  //

  // ── Front matter ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  //
  // pandoc's --standalone renders title/author/date from the note's
  // metadata through the reference doc's Title, Author and Date styles,
  // so the docx chain has always produced a centred block here.
  //
  // Unconditional: mla and chicago route to their own templates now, so
  // every note reaching this one wants exactly this block. It used to be
  // guarded on `style == "" or style == "basic"`, which meant a note
  // whose style: was a typo -- anything that falls back to this template
  // -- silently lost its title, author and date altogether.
  //
  // Title is 28pt centred with w:after=80tw; Author and Date are 12pt
  // centred. The three gaps below are measured off a LibreOffice render
  // rather than derived, because Word's box model and LibreOffice's
  // interpretation of it do not agree closely enough to compute them:
  // the target is where the ink actually lands.
  //
  // Braced so the set rule stays inside it. These values are the front
  // matter's own -- single leading, no paragraph gap, no indent -- and
  // must not reach the body, which is double-spaced and indented. A set
  // rule runs to the end of its enclosing block, so at conf()'s top
  // level it would silently restyle the whole document.
